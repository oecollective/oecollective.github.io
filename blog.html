        <p>To whom it may concern.</p>
        <p>293, That is the number of shootings that have happened in the United States of America in just 2018 alone. This is not left side propaganda nor is it a right side article written in blind loyalty. These are the thoughts of the "OEC" we give these beliefs in hope that you learn something in our effort to change the world. We are being fed cultural beliefs on a disgustingly cheaply made plate of society called media. The human race has become paranoid, scared to look our neighbors in the eyes as we pass them in the streets, scared to go to school the next day because you know you could be the next kid giving speeches in Washington that fall upon deaf ears. These are the reasons why the OEC has decided to intervene in this issue, this dilemma that our "Government" has created.</p>
        <p>"All mankind... being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions" - John Locke</p>
        <p>A human being has a natural right to life, to live however they choose under whatever government or legislative system they desire. The key part of this quote that is commonly ignored is the most mundane aspect of this paradoxical equation, as a human being, you have the right to live. You have the right to breathe, to drink water and to survive. America is built on the basic premises of Locke's belief system, "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". The question stands if American citizens are given the right to live, then why would the government not immediately put restrictions on the things causing fear, paranoia, and most hypocritically death? Article 2 of the constitution of the United States of America, that is the reason why because it is also stated that citizens have the right to bear arms. An average musket in the time of the writing of these documents could fire 2-4 round bullets a minute depending on the reload speed of the operator. The M134 Minigun is the fastest firing firearm in the world today, it can shoot 6,000 needles tipped bullets a minute. 5,996 bullets. That is the true reason you can not quote Article 2 as a viable source of current political and social stature concerning firearm laws. That is also the argument that needs to be made, however. Those high school kids that marched on Washington had a good intention and words that needed to be said but didn't change anything, because they worked off the ignorant belief system that the government gives a damn what they think anymore. You can not go to your untrustworthy neighbor's house, piss on their rug then ask for a cup of sugar. We must close our mouths and pick up our signs. We must not march on Washington we must run, sprint and bound into Washington. </p>
        <p>The OEC has granted the supporters of those protesting the gun violence in America, the NRA, and other corrupt organizations with all of its power and resources in this battle. Because we as a collective think that this war cannot be won on the floors of the capitol building but must be won on the streets of Washington, New York, Chicago and every other city in America. We will live up to our end of the bargain and we will grant protection, cyber firepower, and manpower to aid in this fight.</p>
